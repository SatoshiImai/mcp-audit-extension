"""What a tool does with a session that was not audit-negotiated (§6.2).

A tool that speaks this extension has to stay usable by hosts that do not, which is nearly every MCP
host today. In an unnegotiated session it sends no audit message at all - a host that did not declare
the extension answers an undeclared method with a JSON-RPC error, which §6 requires the tool to read
as a failure to record, so a tool that sends anyway fails closed against a peer that has done nothing
wrong - and serves `tools/call` exactly as a build without this extension would.

Two postures are admissible. Under **degraded** (the default) the tool serves the call and records
into an audit host it provides for itself: the recording does not stop, the host's witness does, and
§5.2 makes that legible in the records. Under **mandatory** the tool declines to serve, which
[SEP-2133] permits for an extension a deployment treats as required.

A third posture - serving the call while recording nothing and reporting nothing about the omission -
is not conformant, so `transport_for` refuses to return a transport for it: taking the degraded
posture requires somewhere to record.
